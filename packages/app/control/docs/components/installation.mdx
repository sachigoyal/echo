# Installation

This guide will walk you through installing Echo Components in your project using the Shadcn CLI.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Echo Components, make sure you have:

- A React or Next.js project
- [Shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) installed
- Echo SDK already set up in your project

## Installing Components

### Using Shadcn CLI

Echo Components are distributed through our custom registry at [echo-components.com](https://echo-components.com/). You can install them using the Shadcn CLI:

```bash
# Install Echo Account component for React
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://echo-components.com/r/echo-account-react.json

# Install Echo Account component for Next.js
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://echo-components.com/r/echo-account-next.json
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install components manually, you can:

1. Visit [echo-components.com](https://echo-components.com/)
2. Browse the available components
3. Copy the component code directly into your project
4. Install any required dependencies

## Dependencies

Echo Components require several dependencies that will be automatically installed:

### Required Dependencies

- `@radix-ui/react-popover` - For popover functionality
- `@radix-ui/react-skeleton` - For loading states
- `@radix-ui/react-avatar` - For user avatars
- `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` - For tooltips
- `autonumeric` - For money input formatting

### Echo SDK Dependencies

Make sure you have the appropriate Echo SDK installed:

```bash
# For React projects
npm install @merit-systems/echo-react-sdk

# For Next.js projects
npm install @merit-systems/echo-next-sdk
```

## Project Setup

### 1. Configure Shadcn

If you haven't already, initialize Shadcn in your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

### 2. Install Base Dependencies

Echo Components build on top of Shadcn's base components. Make sure you have the required base components:

```bash
# Install required base components
npx shadcn@latest add popover
npx shadcn@latest add skeleton
npx shadcn@latest add avatar
npx shadcn@latest add input
npx shadcn@latest add tooltip
```

### 3. Set Up Echo Provider

Make sure your Echo provider is properly configured in your app:

```tsx
// For React apps
import { EchoProvider } from '@merit-systems/echo-react-sdk';

function App() {
  return (
    <EchoProvider>
      {/* Your app content */}
    </EchoProvider>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// For Next.js apps
import { EchoProvider } from '@merit-systems/echo-next-sdk';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <EchoProvider>
          {children}
        </EchoProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Verification

After installation, you can verify that Echo Components are working by adding a simple Echo Account component to your app:

```tsx
import { EchoAccount } from '@/components/echo-account-react';

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Echo App</h1>
      <EchoAccount />
    </div>
  );
}
```

If the component renders without errors and shows the Echo account interface, your installation is successful!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Component not found errors:**
- Make sure you've installed the Echo SDK
- Verify that the Echo provider is wrapping your app
- Check that all required base components are installed

**Styling issues:**
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- Check that your `tailwind.config.js` includes the component paths
- Verify that CSS variables for theming are set up

**TypeScript errors:**
- Make sure TypeScript is configured to resolve the component paths
- Check that all type definitions are properly imported
